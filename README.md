## Visual CNN Hyperparameter Analysis for Image Segmentation Via Pre-trained Network Features

This is the first code part of my bachelors thesis.
This repo is based on a U-Net implementation by https://github.com/zhixuhao.
The model was modified to enable quick training with different hyperparameters using command-line commands. The `cluster.py` file allowed me to train a variety of U-Nets on my universities high-performance cluster, PALMA 2. The training was monitored using Tensorflow, and results were saved. To see the results visualized, visit my second repo: https://github.com/mkais13/unet-vis-ba.
